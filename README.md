## Gameplay
With at least two human players one hosts the game session and the other connects to it.
The game instantly starts and follows the standard last man standing pattern BUT you can choose between
9 different bomb types giving possibilities of combination thus creating different tactics. Each player
has an amount X of gold that gets replenished over time and can be increased by killing other players or picking up items
and coins. Every special bomb you place costs you gold. This forces the player to tactically use special bombs in order to achive victory instead of spamming them.
Speaking of items there are item spawner on each map which will periodically spawn upgrades like
range upgrades, coin bags, speed upgrade ecc. These are the "hot points" where players gather and fight.
But these item spawners can also spawn some bombs so that players have to move away and give enemies a chance to grab some items.
